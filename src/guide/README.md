GoldenSpace is a collection of projects, frontend runs separately from the backend. It's convenient for developers and ~~it can avoid you to quarrel with people in other fields.~~

It has a high degree of development freedom, you can develop your own front/middle background through the interface.

## The structure of the GoldenSpace
